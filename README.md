## What is Software Engineering ?
- s/w engineering is the systematic approach to the design and development of s/w.
- Responsibilities of a s/w engineer include:
    - Designing, building, and maintaining s/w systems.
    - Writing and testing code.
    - Consulting with stakeholders, third party vendors, security specialists, and other team members.
- s/w engineers build systems while s/w developers implement specific functionalitites.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Systematic process to develop high-quality s/w.
- Its initial development in the 60s and 70s was driven by the need for a systematic approach because of the growing complexity of s/w.
- Aims to produce s/w that meets requirements.
- Defines phases with their own processes and deliverables.
- Cycle of planning, design, and development that can be implemented as an iterative approach.
- Minimizes risks and costs to the development of high-quality, deployable s/w.

## Advantages of the SDLC:
- It gives development teams a process to follow rather than using an adhoc approach to improve efficiency and reduce risks.
- There are discrete phases to the SDLC. Each phase is well defined so that team members know what they should be working on and when.
- Because of the well-defined phases, it facilitates communication b/w the customer, other stakeholders, and the development team.
- Since each phase is discrete, cross-domain teams know when they have completed their tasks and when development can move to the next phase.
- The SDLC provides room for iteration where at the end of a cycle the process can circle back to incorporate additional requirements as needed.
- Each team member has a well-defined role which reduces conflict and overlapping responsibilities.
