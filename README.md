## What is Software Engineering ?
- s/w engineering is the systematic approach to the design and development of s/w.
- Responsibilities of a s/w engineer include:
    - Designing, building, and maintaining s/w systems.
    - Writing and testing code.
    - Consulting with stakeholders, third party vendors, security specialists, and other team members.
- s/w engineers build systems while s/w developers implement specific functionalitites.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Systematic process to develop high-quality s/w.
- Its initial development in the 60s and 70s was driven by the need for a systematic approach because of the growing complexity of s/w.
- Aims to produce s/w that meets requirements.
- Defines phases with their own processes and deliverables.
- Cycle of planning, design, and development that can be implemented as an iterative approach.
- Minimizes risks and costs to the development of high-quality, deployable s/w.

## Advantages of the SDLC:
- It gives development teams a process to follow rather than using an adhoc approach to improve efficiency and reduce risks.
- There are discrete phases (the tasks from a previous phase don't ovelap with the tasks in the next phase) in the SDLC. Each phase is well defined so that team members know what they should be working on and when.
- Because of the well-defined phases, it facilitates communication b/w the customer, other stakeholders, and the development team.
- Since each phase is discrete, cross-domain teams know when they have completed their tasks and when development can move to the next phase.
- The SDLC provides room for iteration where at the end of a cycle the process can circle back to incorporate additional requirements as needed.
- Each team member has a well-defined role which reduces conflict and overlapping responsibilities.

## Phases of the SDLC
- There are generally 6 phases in s/w development process:
  1. Planning
  2. Design
  3. Development
  4. Testing
  5. Deployment
  6. Maintenance
 
1. Planning: In this phase, requirements are gathered, analyzed, documented and prioritized. As part of the planning process, labor and material costs are estimated and weighed against time constraints. Also, project teams are identified, and roles of each member are proposed. If the stakeholders are struggling to define requirements, a prototype can be produced by the development team to get stakeholder feedback and establish requirements.
After the requirements have been gathered, they are combined into a document called SRS (Software Requirements Specification). The SRS needs to be clearly understood and approved by all stakeholders.

2. Design: In this phase, the requirements from the SRS are used to develop the s/w architecture.The architecture is reviewed by the stakeholder and the team. During this phase prototypes can be designed. A prototype is a small-scale replica of the end product used foor demonstration purposes. The document created in this phase is called a design document, and is used by the developers during the next phase, which is the development phase.

3. Development : In this phase, the developers start the coding process once the design document is completed. The project planners use the design document to determine and assign coding tasks.This phase often requires the use of programming tools, different programming languages and s/w stacks. Organizations may also have standards or guidelines that need to be followed.
